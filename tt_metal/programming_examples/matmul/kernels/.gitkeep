# This is a dummy file to ensure that git adds this empty kernel folder
# Even an empty kernel folder is necessary because it's how the CI pipeline differentiates
# Between root example folders (that contain the CMakeLists to build executables) and
# Parent example folders, like contributed, that exist to group sub examples.
# Matmul is a root example folder because it builds examples directly using the CMakeLists in it
